Game of Life (credit John Conway) with modifications for fun


To run: 

---Option 1 is to n run the "game.exe" file inside the "dist" directory.
	
---Option 2 is to run the "game.py" file in the root directory. The code was built an environment
using python 3.10.7 and uses the pygame library. You will need the pygame library downloaded to 
run the python file, but it seems to work with other versions of python 3 (e.g. 3.9.5), although 
it is not guaranteed to.
