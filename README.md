Game of Life (credit John Conway) with modifications for fun


To run: 

---Option 1 is to download the "dist" folder and then run the "game.exe" file
which is located inside of that folder. 
	
---Option 2 is to run the "game.py" file in the root directory. For this to work, you need to use pip to get 
the right python version and libraries.
